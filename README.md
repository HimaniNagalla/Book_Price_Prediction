# Book Price Prediction 

## Introduction

Welcome to the Book Price Prediction project. The objective of this project is to predict the price of books based on a variety of features. The project utilizes machine learning and data science techniques to create an accurate predictive model.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

### 1. Data Preprocessing

In the `data_preprocessing` directory, you'll find scripts and Jupyter notebooks dedicated to cleaning and preparing the dataset for modeling. This includes handling missing values, converting categorical variables into numerical format, and addressing outliers.

### 2. Feature Engineering

The `feature_engineering` section focuses on creating new features or transforming existing ones to provide more meaningful information to the models. Techniques such as binning, scaling, and one-hot encoding are applied to enhance the predictive power of the features.

### 3. Model Building

Our primary approach involves leveraging multiple machine learning models:

- **Random Forest**: An ensemble learning method that builds a multitude of decision trees and merges them together.
- **Gradient Boosting**: A technique that builds trees sequentially, with each one correcting the errors of the previous one.
- **Voting Regressor**: Combines the predictions of multiple models to improve overall performance.

### 4. Hyperparameter Tuning

Optimal hyperparameters significantly impact model performance. We employ techniques such as RandomizedSearchCV to efficiently search through the hyperparameter space and find the best configuration for our models.

### 5. Model Evaluation

To assess the quality of our models, we use various metrics including:

- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Measures the average squared difference between the actual and predicted values.
- **R-squared (R2) Score**: Indicates the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable.
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: Measures the average absolute difference between actual and predicted values.

### 6. Predictions

Once the models are trained and validated, we make predictions on new data or the provided test set.

## How to Use

Follow the instructions in each section's README to replicate the process, from data preprocessing to making predictions.

## Models Used

- **Random Forest**: Known for its flexibility and robustness in handling various data types.
- **Gradient Boosting**: Effective in capturing complex relationships in the data.
- **Voting Regressor**: Capitalizes on the strengths of different models to achieve a more accurate prediction.
